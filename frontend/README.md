# Frontend Template

You can use this repository as a template for your frontend. It provides a very simple
React Router layout with a navbar, an `AuthContext` with login and register pages, and an
`ApiContext` with two custom hooks: `useQuery` and `useMutation`.

## Usage

1. Change the name of the package in `package.json`.
2. Update the environment variables in `example.env` and rename the file to `.env`.
3. Build components and add routes to them in `App.jsx`.
