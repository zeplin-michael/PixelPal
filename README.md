## Description

Welcome to PixelPal! In this game, you take care of your very own cute little PixelPal! It needs your help to stay happy and healthy, by feeding, cleaning, playing and putting to sleep. If you forget to give food to, bath, play with or rest your PixelPal in time, they will get sick and die. This game is inspired by the 90s toy Tamagotchi and is the basis for the site's overall aesthetic.

## Schema Table

The schema table above illustrates the backend functionality of the site. A user is created and from there a pet is chosen, that must be taken care of at specific times throughout the day. Each pet will have their own table that tracks their status throughout their lifespan. These activities will yield rewards that provide in-game currency for the user to then use within the shops to get inventory for their pets. This game is set up in an endless loop where actions will be rewarded to continue increasing the players coin storage and purchases from the shop will be managed by the bank.
